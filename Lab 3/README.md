## CS M152A Lab 3
### Stopwatch

In this assignment, we went through the complete FPGA design flow by designing a stopwatch
circuit and implementing it on the Nexysâ„¢3 Spartan-6 FPGA Board. The inputs of the stopwatch
are buttons and slider switches. By implementing it we reviewed the design techniques we
learned from previous labs. The digits of the stopwatch are displayed through the on-board seven
segment display. To configure it we needed to study and explore the reference manuals, which
was also an essential step in more realistic and complex digital design tasks.
